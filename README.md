# Practice-App-with-API
# This is just a simple practice site I wrote using Mongo, express, node and bootstrap. 
# The site allows a user to search up technology related books using an API request, the data is then dynamically loaded onto the page.
# The site also has a section that lets a user write a review on a book and a section to read other reviews that have been written.
